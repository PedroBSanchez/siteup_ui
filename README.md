# About

The objective of this project is to develop a user-friendly platform that enables users to save and organize website URLs for easy access. The platform will provide users with a straightforward interface to input and categorize website links based on their preferences. Additionally, the platform will incorporate a service monitoring feature that periodically checks the functionality of the saved websites. Users will receive notifications if any of the saved websites experience downtime or disruptions in their services. This project aims to enhance users' ability to keep track of their favorite websites and ensure their online resources are functioning smoothly.
